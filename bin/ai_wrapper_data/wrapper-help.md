# Claude Wrapper Help

This wrapper provides an interactive menu for starting Claude CLI sessions with
optional orchestration workflows. It also supports multiple Claude accounts
(e.g. personal and corporate) with automatic profile selection.

## Account Selection

On each interactive launch, the wrapper checks for account profile directories
at `~/.claude-<name>/`. If two or more exist, an account picker is shown before
the session menu. The chosen account's credentials are bound into the sandbox;
the session menu header reflects the active account (e.g. `Claude CLI [private]`).

### Setting up profiles

```bash
# Copy your current ~/.claude into named profiles
cp -a ~/.claude ~/.claude-private
cp -a ~/.claude ~/.claude-corporate   # then log in to the corporate account

# Optional: separate settings files per profile
cp ~/.claude.json ~/.claude-private.json
cp ~/.claude.json ~/.claude-corporate.json
```

Inside the corporate profile, run `claude auth login` (or set the API key) to
authenticate that account. The two profiles are fully isolated — each session
only sees its own credentials.

### Non-interactive / scripted use

Set the `CLAUDE_ACCOUNT` environment variable to skip the menu:

```bash
CLAUDE_ACCOUNT=corporate claude_wrapper.bash --some-flag
```

### Fallback behaviour

- **No profiles** (`~/.claude-*/` directories absent): uses `~/.claude` as-is,
  no account prompt shown. Fully backwards-compatible.
- **Single profile**: auto-selected silently, no prompt.
- **`~/.claude-<name>.json` absent**: falls back to the shared `~/.claude.json`.

## Menu Options

### 1) Start orchestration
Launches Claude with the `orchestrator-mode` skill pre-loaded as a system prompt.
Use for multi-phase development workflows: plan → implement → test → review → merge.

**Phases:**
- Phase 0: Project verification
- Phase 1: Planning (produces `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`)
- Phase 2: Implementation (TDD, per-task subagents)
- Phase 3: Testing (test plan + automated tests)
- Phase 4: Code review
- Phase 5: Documentation
- Phase 6: Finalization (merge options)

### 2) Start bulletproof
Launches Claude with the `bulletproof` skill pre-loaded as a system prompt.
Use for the 12-stage adaptive development workflow (research → spec → plan →
implement → verify → review → deploy).

### 3) Start new conversation
Launches a plain Claude session with no additional system prompt.

### 4) Resume from list
Resumes a previous Claude session (Claude will show a session picker).

### h) Help
Shows this help document.
